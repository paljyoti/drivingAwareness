          On the speed-awareness course, the trainer will use videos and other
          visual aids to encourage you to respect speed limits in future and
          improve your driving skills. Don’t worry, it’s not all gruesome crash
          footage. The emphasis is on getting drivers to think about why they
          should avoid speeding and teaching them practical ways they can drive
          more safely. There’s a lot of focus on group discussion and
          participation.
