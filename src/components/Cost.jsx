      <h1><strong> Speed Awareness Course Pricing </strong></h1>
      <p>
        The pricing for a speed awareness course can fluctuate based on your
        geographical area, typically falling within the range of £80 to £120.
        This range closely aligns with the expense of a typical speeding fine;
        however, opting for a speed awareness course enables you to sidestep
        accruing penalty points on your license.
