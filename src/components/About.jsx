          possess comprehensive knowledge of road awareness and safety beyond
          just practical driving skills.

          Introduced in 2001, the hazard perception test added another dimension
          to this examination, evaluating individuals' ability to identify
          potential hazards on the road through video-based scenarios.
          Successfully passing the theory test is a prerequisite before
          undertaking the practical driving test. Preparing for the theory test
          is a vital component of learning to drive. Concurrently revising and
          mastering driving theory alongside practical lessons can greatly
          enhance your overall driving skills. To obtain your driving theory
          test certificate, you must pass both segments of the test – the theory
          questions and the hazard perception section. Failing either component
          necessitates retaking the entire test, underscoring the importance of
          thorough preparation.
