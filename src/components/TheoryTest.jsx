          <h1>Driving Theory Test</h1>
          <p className="paragraph">
            Since its inception in 1996, the driving theory test has been an
            integral part of ensuring drivers possess comprehensive knowledge of
            road awareness and safety beyond just practical driving skills.
            Introduced in 2001, the hazard perception test added another
            dimension to this examination, evaluating individuals' ability to
            identify potential hazards on the road through video-based
            scenarios. Successfully passing the theory test is a prerequisite
            before undertaking the practical driving test. Preparing for the
            theory test is a vital component of learning to drive. Concurrently
            revising and mastering driving theory alongside practical lessons
            can greatly enhance your overall driving skills. To obtain your
            driving theory test certificate, you must pass both segments of the
            test – the theory questions and the hazard perception section.
            Failing either component necessitates retaking the entire test,
            underscoring the importance of thorough preparation..
